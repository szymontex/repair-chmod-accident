# repair-chmod-accident
System Permissions Restorer; This script helps restore system file permissions that might have been accidentally modified using commands like 'chmod -R 777 /*'. It is designed to be used on a system where the '/mnt/img_mount' directory represents a system partition from a backup where permissions can be read.
